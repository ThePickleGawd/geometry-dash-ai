Guys: we are using `uv`. It will setup venv and all that and sync it. It's also faster than pip

# Example

`uv run main.py`
`uv add torch`
`uv sync # Not needed since it'll auto sync when you run`

Step 1:

1. Implement dueling dqn (HARD)
2. Make it color invariant (EASY)
3. Check the rocket jump (MEDIUM)
4. Fix reward function or check it atleast (MEDIUM)
